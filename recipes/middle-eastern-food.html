    <p>Tabbouleh is a refreshing and vibrant Levantine salad made primarily 
        with finely chopped parsley, mint, tomatoes, onions, and soaked bulgur 
        wheat. Dressed simply with olive oil and lemon juice, it’s known for its 
        fresh, zesty flavor and light, fluffy texture. Unlike grain-heavy 
        salads, traditional tabbouleh uses just a small amount of bulgur, 
        letting the herbs be the star of the dish. The combination of juicy 
        tomatoes and lemony dressing balances the earthy, grassy tones of the 
        parsley, making it both aromatic and satisfying.</p>

    <p>Often served as part of a mezze platter alongside hummus, baba 
        ghanoush, and pita bread, tabbouleh is not only delicious but also 
        highly nutritious. It’s rich in fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins, 
        especially from the parsley and fresh vegetables. Tabbouleh’s 
        appeal lies in its simplicity, its use of fresh ingredients, and 
        its adaptability—it can be enjoyed as a side, a light main course, 
        or a topping for wraps and sandwiches. This salad remains a staple 
        in Middle Eastern cuisine and continues to gain popularity worldwide 
        as a healthy, plant-based dish.</p>
