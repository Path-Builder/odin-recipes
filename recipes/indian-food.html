<img src="images/curry.jpg" alt="Rice and Cauliflower Curry" width="500">

<p>Indian vegetarian curry is a richly spiced and flavorful dish that showcases 
    the diverse ingredients and aromatic traditions of Indian cuisine. Typically 
    made with a combination of vegetables such as potatoes, peas, cauliflower, 
    carrots, or chickpeas, the curry is simmered in a sauce crafted from onions, 
    tomatoes, garlic, ginger, and a blend of warming spices like turmeric, 
    cumin, coriander, and garam masala. The result is a thick, fragrant stew 
    that balances heat, earthiness, and a touch of sweetness. Depending on the 
    region, the base can be tomato-based, coconut milk-based, or yogurt-based, 
    each offering a unique texture and flavor profile.</p>

<p>Often served with steamed rice or flatbreads like naan or roti, Indian 
    vegetarian curry is a satisfying and wholesome meal that appeals to 
    both vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. It’s not only comforting and 
    hearty but also nutrient-dense, thanks to the variety of vegetables and 
    legumes. Whether it’s a North Indian-style aloo gobi or a South Indian 
    vegetable sambar, each version reflects local ingredients and cooking 
    styles, making Indian vegetarian curry one of the most versatile and 
    beloved dishes in global cuisine.</p>
