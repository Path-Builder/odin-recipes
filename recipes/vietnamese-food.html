    <p>Vegetarian pho noodles are a plant-based twist on the traditional 
        Vietnamese pho, a fragrant noodle soup known for its deeply flavorful 
        broth and aromatic herbs. Instead of using beef or chicken, vegetarian 
        pho is built on a rich vegetable broth simmered with ingredients like 
        charred onions, ginger, star anise, cloves, cinnamon, and sometimes 
        mushrooms or kombu for extra umami depth. This broth forms the soul of 
        the dish, infusing it with warmth and complexity while remaining 
        entirely meat-free. The noodles used are typically flat rice noodles, 
        which are light and slippery, soaking up the savory flavors of the broth 
        beautifully.</p>

    <p>Toppings in vegetarian pho vary but often include tofu (either soft 
        or fried), bok choy, bean sprouts, scallions, Thai basil, cilantro, 
        lime wedges, and sometimes chili peppers or hoisin and sriracha 
        sauces for added heat and sweetness. The dish is both comforting 
        and customizable, appealing to a wide range of tastes and dietary 
        needs. Vegetarian pho is popular not just among vegetarians and 
        vegans, but also with anyone looking for a lighter, plant-based meal 
        that doesn’t sacrifice flavor or satisfaction. It’s a nourishing, 
        soul-soothing bowl perfect for any time of day.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Place vegetable stock, onion, soy sauce, garlic, cinnamon sticks, 
            ground ginger, star anise, and bay leaves in a large pot; bring to 
            a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until flavors combine, 30 to 
            45 minutes. Remove solids with a slotted spoon and keep broth hot.</li>
        
        <li>Place noodles in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Set

            thoroughly. Divide noodles among 6 serving bowls.</li>
        
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. 
            Add tofu in a single layer and fry, in batches, until golden brown, 
            about 6 minutes per side.</li>
        
        <li>Simmer fried tofu and mushrooms in broth until heated through, 
            about 5 minutes. Transfer to serving bowls. Top with scallions and 
            cilantro. Ladle in hot broth.</li>
        
        <li>Serve lime wedges, jalapeno peppers, bean sprouts, and basil 
            alongside for garnishing each bowl.</li>
